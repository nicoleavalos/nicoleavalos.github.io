  <p>
 I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Mass Communications with a specialization in Digital Media at Texas State University. While working on my master’s degree, I work as the graduate assistant in the marketing department at the LBJ Student Center. My role there is website management, digital signage, social media, and GSP checking on all marketing material that is created in the design center.
Prior to coming to Texas State, I was in undergrad at The University of Texas at San Antonio. I majored in Marketing and Entrepreneurship while there and graduated summa cum laude with my Bachelor of Business Administration this past May. During undergraduate I worked as a Marketing Assistant, where I managed all social media platforms and was in charge of creating content that implemented strategies and tactics that would help to grow our followers, engage clients, and help convert leads. My career interests are in the social media marketing and digital marketing field.

   Recently, I was accepted to study abroad this summer in London and Geneva. This will be my very first time going “across the pond,” so I am really looking forward to being there. I am also currently enrolled in Texas State’s SXSW class which will be covering the SXSW Interactive Conference this year. I was assigned to work on the social media team for this project, so I will be creating SSN strategies and ideas with fellow graduate students to share what is happening throughout the conference.

  Aside from my love of marketing, I am also a dog mom to two amazing dogs! Gizmo, although small, is very mighty. Like most Chihuahuas, Gizmo can be pretty finicky, but he makes up for it with his vibrant personality and his blatant refusal to follow directions. Catching him on the kitchen counter or rummaging through the trash can is a daily occurrence. Teddy, an Australian Shepard, is one of the most kind-hearted animals you will ever meet. Unlike Gizmo, Teddy is obedient and friendly. Unfortunately, he sometimes forgets his size and will throw his entire body onto you while laying down. Being able to come home to two over-excited dogs every day makes any girl feel special.

When I am not at school or work, I try and travel as much as possible. I have always been an avid traveler and believe that experiencing new places and things is important. My family and I usually go on about three vacations per year, so I have been lucky enough to see a lot of the United States and experience a lot of cool things. I also enjoy the occasion Netflix binge. I have watched The Office, Parks & Rec and Pretty Little Liars more times than I’d like to admit. However, I'm also a big reader as well. These are just a few things about myself, if you'd like to know more please feel free to reach out to me.
