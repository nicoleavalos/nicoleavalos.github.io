        <time>January 21, 2017</time> 24 hours after Donald Trump is elected President of The United States of America, millions of people from around the world congregated to march in support of equality for all. The <a href="https://www.womensmarch.com/"> Women's March </a> movement is aimed at dismantling systems of oppression for various minority groups such as Women's Rights, Immigrant Rights, LGBTQIA rights, etc. The Women's March in 2017 was the largest coordinated protest in U.S. history and one of the largest in world history.  <img style="width:350px;" src= "womensrights.jpg">

        <time>February 8, 2017</time> When Senate Republicans tried to quiet Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) during a long critique criticizing Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, Warren refused to be quiet. Her tenacity and refusal to comply prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s comment: “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,” which inadvertently set off a viral meme of feminist resistance.

        <time>February 19, 2017</time> After experiencing sexual harrassment and gender inequality in the workplace, former engineer Susan Fowler writes a <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber"> blog post </a>  about the experiences and struggles she faced while working at Uber. She recounts the implicit lack of response or help she recieved from HR, as well as the blatant injustice she dealt with on a daily basis. This post inadvertently unmasked many of the challenges women are faced with when working in the tech industry due to its highly male dominated nature. </br><img style="width:300px;" src="equality.JPG">
