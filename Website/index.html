      <h1 style="text-align: center; color:#193242;">  UNDERSTANDING INFLUENCER MARKETING </h1>
      <p>
        With the emergence of social media platforms and the Internet, companies find themselves in a position where traditional marketing strategies are no longer sufficient to reach and influence their target audience. Marketers have been forced to acknowledge the changing marketing environment and role social media platforms like Instagram have in this new digital landscape. In a time when social media is king, marketers must now learn how to survive in the era of the empowered customer, where a combination of less traditional marketing tactics and a better understanding of the role of technology and the engagement of consumers is crucial to brand success (Bijen, 2017). Consumers have turned to the Internet and social media for information on products or brands, as well as to share their experiences online with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        This trend has forced marketers to develop new and more digital focused marketing strategies as a way to connect with their target demographic. Among the new digital marketing tactics currently being used by marketers is influencer marketing. Influencer marketing leverages the influencer’s established follower base and utilizes influential opinion leaders to create, deliver and spread advertising messages to consumers in a more innovative and effective way than traditional advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a recent report, 70% of millennial consumers said they were influenced by the recommendations of their peers in buying decisions. (Pierucci, 2018). Furthermore, the same survey revealed that 30% of consumers are more likely to buy a product recommended by a non-celebrity blogger. Influencers were found to be more relatable, therefore their opinions were valued more than that of a celebrity. (Pierucci, 2018). Studies have also shown that consumers trust recommendations made by influencers more than regular corporate messaging (Wu & Wang, 2011), meaning that the effectiveness of traditional advertising and marketing messages has decreased. Almost 75% of consumers said they relied on social media to influence their purchasing decisions (Bennett, 2014). Because of the large user numbers and the trust consumers place in electronic word of mouth, companies now partner with influencers to drive their marketing messages to a more targeted audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        While influencer marketing has become a new trend in marketing strategies over the last few years, marketers still see and use influencers as an additional advertisement avenue as opposed to the primary strategy. In a recent study, marketers found that for each dollar spent on influencer marketing, marketers see an average of $7.65 in earned media value returned (Fastenau, 2018). However, companies such as Glossier, Revolve and Daniel Wellington have kick-started their fast-growing company almost completely by using influencer marketing. As with any new method, influencer marketing comes with an entirely new set of best practices specific to working with influencers. This white paper aims to uncover some of the most commonly used best practices being utilized by eight different influencer marketing specialist from around the world. I will also discuss how marketers can implement influencer marketing in the most effective and efficient way.

      <h1 style="text-align: center; color:#193242;">  WHY IS INFLUENCER MARKETING IMPORTANT?
    </h1>
<p>
  While traditional marketing methods are still effective, it has been proven in recent studies that influencer marketing has been able to not only create a more authentic brand association, but also influence consumer to purchase a product more than traditional advertising. Influencer marketing continues to be a crucial feature in the marketing process, as consumers use the advice of others to make purchase decisions, especially when the purchase holds financial and psychological risk (Staden et al, 2018).
</p>
<p>
  <h3> <b> Human-to-Human</b> </h3>
  Influencer marketing, when implemented correctly, draws upon the two-way communication opportunity that social media networks provides, thereby creating a more personable brand association. It allows for a very personal connection that brands can’t have with consumers. An influencer marketing specialist from Amsterdam said “people have begun to tune out brands talking about brands, they are looking for a more human-to-human interactions.”  Compared to more traditional marketing methods, influencer marketing also gives consumers the opportunity to message and ask questions about products or brands, while traditional marketing methods does not have the same space for that type of communication (Biaudet, 2017).
</p>
<p>
  <h3> <b> Credibility & Authenticity</b> </h3>
  One of the most widely known benefits of influencer marketing is the credibility and authenticity associated with this type of marketing tactic. “Influencer marketing is like word of mouth but times 1000,” says Amsterdam based marketing specialist. By leveraging existing credibility and equity that someone else has brands are better able to convince consumers to try or buy their product. Another marketing expert compared influencer marketing as “the equivalent of getting a five-star review of a product from your best friend.” Consumers are tired of being told by brands that they are amazing, they no longer trust that kind of advertisement.  The director of eBay and P&G, Scott Cook, is quoted saying, “a brand is no longer what we tell consumers it is, it is what consumers tell each other it is.”
</p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  <h3> <b> Expanded Audience</b> </h3>
  When asking what some of the biggest benefits of using influencer marketing was, marketing experts said leveraging an influencer’s follower base. Having the opportunity to get in front of someone else’s audience who you would otherwise not be seen by considerably increases your brand reach. Many times consumers don’t directly follow brands, so collaborating with influencers can help to bring either brand awareness or strengthen brand loyalty with those followers.

      <h1 style="text-align: center; color:#193242;">  WHEN SHOULD YOU USE INFLUENCER MARKETING? </h1>
  <p>
    When thinking about whether or not influencer marketing would be right for you, a key aspect to think about is what you are trying to achieve. While influencer marketing can be a very effective marketing strategy, it isn’t always the answer for what you may be looking to achieve. When speaking with influencer specialists the most common reasons to use influencer marketing were as follows:

  </p>

  <p>
    <h3> <b> Brand Awareness & Reach </b> </h3>
    “The main objective when using influencer marketing is reaching an audience that would not otherwise been reached through more traditional marketing strategies,” says influencer expert.
  One of the best examples of this is Daniel Wellington’s successful Instagram influencer marketing strategy. The brand relies exclusively on influencer marketing and has yet to change their strategy (Mottola, 2016). There are currently 1.9 million posts on Instagram tagged #danielwellington and only 5.9K posts on the actual Daniel Wellington page, which means the rest have been posted by the brand’s followers. This highly-effective strategy has cost the company little to no money at all, however the reach and brand awareness they have culminated through this campaign has brought in millions in sales (Influencity, 2018).

    <h3> <b> Engagement</b> </h3>
   One of the most common reasons marketers choose to use influencer marketing is to create higher engagement rates with consumers. In a recent study conducted, micro-influencer campaigns had a 60% higher engagement rate than traditional advertising.
</p>
   <p>
     An example of this is a campaign called #willfindsaway that was recently launched this year. The campaign was focused on promoting a new collection of Under Armour clothing in the UK, Germany and France. However, instead of just running a normal social media strategy pushing the products, the brand chose to use influencers marketing to dig much deeper than that. For this campaign, Under Armour partnered with both a macro-influencer and multiple micro-influencers to post on Instagram featuring the branded hashtag, #willfindaway, the new Under Armour products, as well as shared a personal struggle or battle they’ve had and how sports helped them overcome it. Not only did the results from the campaign create massive engagement, this also got other Instagram users to use this hashtag.

  </blockquote>
<p>
      <h3> <b> Sales/Conversions</b> </h3>
      A study conducted by Nielsen, found that influencer marketing content delivered 11 times higher return on investment than traditional forms of digital marketing (Ahmad, 2018).
      One of the best examples of influencer marketing being used as a mechanism to drive sales and conversion is the marketing strategy used by makeup company, Glossier. Since the brand launch, Glossier has marketed their product almost entirely using influencer marketing on Instagram and YouTube.

<p>  According to Weiss, revenues are up 600% year over year and the brand has been able to triple their active customer count in the past year by implementing influencer marketing strategies (Liu, 2017). One of their most successful launches has actually been gifting 500 super fans who had previously bought the most products or were the most engaged with the new product.

      <h1 style="text-align: center; color:#193242;">  WHAT MAKES A SUCCESSFUL INFLUENCER MARKETING CAMPAIGN? </h1>
<p>
Since marketers have started using influencer marketing more and more, the development of industry best practices have emerged when implementing an influencer strategies. Below is a list of some of the most common practices brought up when speaking with marketing experts, specifically for Instagram.
</p>
<p>
  <h3> <b> Cultivate Meaningful Relationships </b> </h3>
    Unlike billboards, influencers are living breathing human beings who deserve to be treated as more than an ad unit. By creating a relationship with influencers you can create mutual benefits such as established trust, knowledge of each other, a ready customer base, and the opportunity of switching the brand influencer to a brand advocate (Biaudet, 2017). When discussing the most important parts of influencer marketing, almost all experts expressed that long-term relationships between brands and influencers are essential for successful collaboration. It was also suggested that once the campaign is finished, thanking the influencer for their participation and letting them know you’d be interested in working with them again helped when collaborating on future projects.

A lot of people tend to just give a free product instead of having a strategy and builing a relationship." </br></br>
  </p>
</blockquote>

  <p>
    <h3> <b> Measure Results </b> </h3>
    What’s the point of marketing without results? Like any other marketing tactic, influencer marketing needs to be managed from before the campaign even starts to after the campaign ends to truly get of sense of how successful the campaign was. In order to track these results one may have to get creative to measure the results, but consider using some of the following:

<ul>
  <li> Coupon Codes: Designated codes assigned to a specific influencer as a way to associate any sales made with that code back to that specific campaign.  </li>
  <li> Affiliate Landing Pages: Allows marketers to create a designated landing page for a specific influencer to track website traffic using that designated link. </li>
  <li> Swipe-Up Links: Allows influencer who have 10,000 or more followers to insert a link directly into their Instagram story. </li>
  <li> <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://nicoleavalos.github.io/alissasound.mp3" data-start="810000" data-end="835000" data-plays="1"></span>Google UTMs: A simple code that attaches to a custom URL in order to track a source, medium or campaign name through Google Analytics.</li>
  <li> Branded Hashtags: A designated hashtag associated with a brand, product or campaign that can be searched on social media site to measure engagement.
 </li>
</ul>

With the help of search analytics, listening tools, dedicated messaging, landing pages, and more, marketers can begin to understand who and what is offering the greatest ROI, where they need to adapt brand messages, and which influencer content they should optimize and amplify (Biaudet, 2017). How influencer marketing ROI is measured depends on the objective decided upon prior to campaign launch. If the campaign is focused on brand awareness, marketers would be more concerned about reach. Whereas if the focus of the campaign was engagement, the amount of likes, views, shares or clicks would be a better statistic to analyze.

If they are looking for engagement, you can look at hashtags and see how much conversation was generated around it." </br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    <h3> <b> Set Expectations From the Start </b> </h3>
    Accurately expressing what you want from an influencer is critical to meeting campaign goals. Once you have chosen the influencer or influencers you want to work with, it is crucial to provide them with briefing document that include information such as project timeline, expected post content, guidelines and requirements and compensation details. In certain instances, there can be limitation on what you are able to set as expectations or deliverables since an influencer is not technically being compensated other than receiving a free product.

  </p>
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    <h3> <b> Transparency </b> </h3>
      Consumers are constantly being bombarded with misleading advertisements, so it is important to remain transparent when working with influencers. When speaking with a relatively known influencer about how to balance working with brands and staying transparent with their audience she said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="font-size: 1.2em; height:max-content;">
<img src="samantha.jpeg" alt="Avatar">
“The number one thing is staying true to your brand. It can be very enticing to take on any campaign that come your way because that is direct income, but when you do that, it becomes very obvious to your audience, and therefore, they will slowly lose trust in what you’re putting out there. The best way to stay transparent is really building that connection with your audience by engaging with them often, like answering messages and comments as much as you can. That, in addition to working with brands that you truly believe in and use, is what separates you from the rest.” </p>
</blockquote>

  <p>
    <h3> <b> Storytelling & Innovative Marketing Strategies</b> </h3>
    On top of implementing an influencer strategy, developing a storytelling campaign for influencers can help to make the campaign more relevant and resonate more with followers, as well as increase engagement.
When speaking to a marketing expert she says, “the story is more important than the product when it comes to influencer marketing. People connect with the influencer on a personal level, therefore are more inclined to buy the product when attached to a story.”
For the content to really resonate with the target audience, the influencer needs to tell a story around the brand or product. It has become common to see influencers promoting products, so you have to be careful to not become part of the noise and create a campaign that will stand out and highlight the importance of your brand or product. A brand, service or product is trusted more when an influencer includes a personal story about it as opposed to just offering a product review (Biaudet, 2017).

</p>
<p>
  <h3> <b> Creative Control</b> </h3>
  Conveying authenticity is extremely important when working with influencers. Marketers can ensure a more authentic feel by letting the influencer have some creative control over the content created for the campaign. Influencers should always be given a creative brief which specifies how the brand should be presented, but overall influencers should have complete freedom over the content they create. However, from time to time, certain brands may have specifications in terms of exclusivity. For example, a clothing brand may wish to be the only brand featured in a post and thus must specify that the influencer does not show other pieces of clothing in the post. Aside from specifications such as that, all marketing experts agreed that creative freedom results in some of the best campaign outcomes.

     "The key to achieving our goals starts with selecting the right influencers who have the right audience the brand is trying to reach. From there, we let the influencers create blogs and/or social media content that they publish to their respective channels."
    </p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>
      <h3> <b> Quality over Quantity</b> </h3>
  Start small and choose 2-3 influencers you want to work with and then narrow it down from there. You don’t have to launch a giant campaign with a mega-influencer to move the needle. When using influencer marketing, selecting a couple of micro-influencers as opposed to one mega-influencer can often times be much more successful in creating more engagement and reach, as well as more cost effective.  </p>

      <h1 style="text-align: center; color:#193242;">  HOW TO CHOOSE AN INFLUENCER </h1>
      <p>
        To start an influencer marketing campaign, you have to first find an influencer. So how do you go about choosing which influencer would be the best fit for your brand and brand image? There are many things to take into consideration when creating an influencer marketing campaign, however when speaking with influencer marketing experts the ways in which they identify and choose influencers were relatively the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Businesses have long partnered with celebrities and other high-profile stars as a way to promote products and add credibility to their brand, however social media has given rise to non-celebrity online influencers, particularly on Instagram. Most marketers’ separate these influencers into three different tiers: micro-influencers, macro-influencers and mega-influencers. However, the majority of marketing professionals I spoke with expressed a preferred use of micro or a combination of micro influencers and macro influencers when conducting a campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      While both macro and mega influencers have significant follower counts, that doesn’t necessarily mean they have high engagement rates (Hart, 2017). Marketers have found that with more social savvy consumers the power in influencer marketing isn’t necessary about follower count anymore as it is about getting higher engagement (Hart, 2017).
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the last few years, the trend in influencer marketing has been to utilize more micro-influencers as opposed to those with more followers. Most marketers define micro-influencers as individuals with a smaller following, however they typically have a more expert knowledge on certain niche subjects. Their knowledge in specific subjects is what attracts a more targeted audience following. While their following is smaller, in certain instances choosing a micro-influencer can be more effective due to their more loyal and hyper-targeted communities (Hart, 2017). Since they have a smaller, more intimate following, they are also able to manage a stronger two-way dialogue with their followers as opposed to an influencer with a higher follower count.

      For brands looking to boost online visibility and customer engagement, investing in micro-influencer marketing can be a game-changer.

      However, finding the right micro-influencer can be time-consuming and like trying to find a needle in a haystack. No brand wants to work with influencers who are only concerned about the money, as opposed to really caring about the product they are endorsing. Choosing a serial-influencer, or influencer who works with many different brands risks of looking un-authentic. Here are several ways to help find your perfect influencer:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b> Already Existing Brand Promoters </b></br> Micro-influencers who are already familiar with your brand and have previously used your products can sometimes be the best brand ambassadors. Since they are already familiar with your product or brand, it can be a lot easier to build a more authentic campaign. Influencers are also typically more inclined to partner with products and brands they already believe in, as opposed to new products.

  </li>
  <li><b> Keywords and Hashtags </b></br> Searching keywords and hashtags are especially helpful when looking for more niche influencers. By searching popular industry hashtags on Instagram you'll find out which power players are curating the most engaging content relevant to you and your particular brand. While this method can be time consuming, it is the best way to ensure the influencer’s online image lines up with your brand image.

<blockquote>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; height:max-content;">
  <img src="alissa.jpg" alt="Avatar">
“When you have very niche brands, you have to manually go through and search keywords.”</br></br>
</p>
</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><b> Influencer Databases </b></br> While the above methods can be time consuming, there is a faster way to come up with a list of possible influencers. Influencer databases are software-based directories that help companies to find, research and tract influencers across all social media platforms. This is typically used as a vetting mechanism for marketers to help narrow down their influencer search.
Most databases are filtered through several options such as social media platform, follower/subscriber size, category specialties and location (Mediakix, 2018). While this may provide you with a ready-made curated list of influencers, there can be significant drawbacks to using these databases such as inconsistent data and unreliable influencer vetting.
</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After deciding upon a handful of influencer to possibly work with, it is then important to critically look at the influencer and if they are right for your brand. There are four important factors to look at when examining an influencer: relevance, reach, engagement rate and authenticity (Biaudet, 2017). You want to ensure that you brand image and messaging aligns with the influencers’ content, as well as if your brand or product is relevant to their audience. Taking a look at past posts to get a sense of their feed is a helpful way to gauge if the partnership would be beneficial.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Examining the engagement ratio of the influencer is crucial to determining how meaningful the relationship between the influencer and their audience is. You can determine this by looking at the comments, likes and shares of the influencers’ posts. The third criteria to look for is audience reach. Making sure that the influencers’ audience is the audience you want to reach. Lastly, ensuring the influencer is authentic. Influencers who have less sponsored content on their platform, tend to be seen as more trustworthy and authentic (Biaudet, 2017).
  </p>
  <p>
    While some influencers may receive free products by companies, other more established influencers are paid by companies to promote a product or even sign deals to act as brand ambassadors.

        <h1 style="text-align: center; color:#193242;">  CONCLUSION
      </h1>
<p>
  In a time when most consumers are using ad blockers to avoid brand advertisements, influencer marketing allows brands to break into consumers’ social community in a way that feels much more organic and welcomed because it is relevant, reliable and more relatable to them. With social media growing in inﬂuence and advertising agencies allocating more of their media budgets to social, the advertising industry is in search of effective strategies to get the most return on investment when it comes to social (Wood, 2016). Unfortunately, it is no longer enough to just be present on social media, brands must now be actively trying to engage and relate to their target market. The main objective of this white paper was to provide better understanding of influencer marketing and how it can be used to leverage existing niche communities. Influencer marketing is built upon century old traditions of word of mouth, however with the emergence of social media the number of consumers a person can reach has amplified. As consumers have become more tech savvy, marketers have turned to more digital-based strategies to connect with their customers.
</p>
<p>
    Inﬂuencer marketing is proving to be successful and will continue to grow in popularity as more advertising dollars are allocated towards it. While working with inﬂuencers can be a tricky process, the returns on investment are unparalleled if well executed (Wood, 2016). As more and more marketers adopt influencer marketing as a new strategy, it is important to establish some of the current best practices and industry norms being implemented. However, since social media is constantly changing and evolving it is imperative for marketers to keep up with industry trends and regulations. Inﬂuencer Marketing is relatively new research area that has the potential to be explored. Future research on the difference between micro and macro influencer in relation to reach, engagement and authenticity would be beneficial to this area of study.
