      <h1 style="text-align: center; color:black;">  UNDERSTANDING INFLUENCER MARKETING </h1>
      <p>
        With the emergence of social media sites and the Internet, companies have now found themselves in a position where traditional marketing strategies are no longer enough to reach and influence their target audience. Marketers have been forced to acknowledge the changing marketing environment and role the internet and platforms like Instagram have in this new digital landscape. In a time when social media is king, marketers must now learn how to survive in the era of the empowered customer, where a combination of less traditional marketing tactics and a better understanding of the role of technology and the engagement of consumers is crucial to brand success (Bijen, 2017). Consumers have turned to the Internet and social media for information they want on products or brands, as well as to share their experiences online with others. This new trend has forced marketers to develop new and more digital focused marketing strategies as a way to connect with their target demographic. Among one of the new digital marketing tactics currently being used by marketers is influencer marketing. Influencer marketing utilizes influential opinion leaders to create, deliver and spread advertising messages to consumers in a more innovative and effective way than traditional advertising by leveraging the influencer’s established follower base.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a recent report, 70% of millennial consumers said they were influenced by the recommendations of their peers in buying decisions. (Pierucci, 2018). Furthermore, the same survey revealed that 30% of consumers are more likely to buy a product recommended by a non-celebrity blogger. This is finding is said to be because consumers can relate more to influencers and value their opinion more than that of a celebrity (Pierucci, 2018). Studies have also shown that consumers trust electronic word of mouth more than regular corporate messaging (Wu & Wang, 2011), meaning that the effectiveness of traditional advertising and marketing messages has decreased. Because of the large user numbers, and the trust consumers place in electronic word of mouth, companies now partner with influencers to drive their marketing messages to a more targeted audience. Almost 75% of consumers said they relied on social media to influence their purchasing decisions (Bennett, 2014). While some influencers may receive free products by companies, other more established influencers are paid by companies to promote a product or even sign deals to act as brand ambassadors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although some influencers are focused on one specific social media platform, often influencers use multiple platforms to increase reach and build an established follower base. A 2016 exploratory study on influencer marketing, using in-depth interviews with 13 advertisers, found Instagram as one of the first social media channels to come to mind when the topic was mentioned (Woods, 2016).  From the visually appealing and engaging nature of the platform and the 1 billion active users each month, it is no wonder Instagram is one of the most used channels for influencer marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
        While influencer marketing has become a new trend in marketing strategies over the last few years, marketers still see and use influencers as an additional advertisement avenue as opposed to the primary strategy. However, companies such as Glossier, Revolve and Daniel Wellington have kick-started their booming company almost completely by using influencer marketing. In this white paper, I will discuss how marketers can implement influencer marketing in the most effective and efficient way. I will also take a look at the best practices currently being used by eight marketers from around the world.

      <h1 style="text-align: center; color:black;">  WHY IS INFLUENCER MARKETING IMPORTANT?
    </h1>
<p>
  While traditional marketing methods are still effective, it has been proven time and time again that influencer marketing has been able to not only create a more authentic brand association, but also influence consumer to purchase a product more than traditional advertising. Influencer marketing continues to be a crucial feature in the marketing process, as consumers use the advice of others to make purchase decisions, especially when the purchase holds financial and psychological risk (Staden et al, 2018).
</p>
<p>
  <h3> <b> Human-to-Human</b> </h3>
  Influencer marketing when implemented correctly draws upon the two-way communication opportunity that social media networks provides, thereby creating a more personable brand association. It allows for a very personal connection that brands can’t have with consumers. An influencer marketing specialist from Amsterdam said “people have begun to tune out brands talking about brands, they are looking for a more human-to-human interactions.”  Compared to more traditional marketing methods, influencer marketing also gives consumers the opportunity to message and ask questions about products or brands, while traditional marketing methods does not have the same space for that type of communication (Biaudet, 2017).
</p>
<p>
  <h3> <b> Credibility & Authenticity</b> </h3>
  One of the most widely known benefits of influencer marketing is the credibility and authenticity associated with this type of marketing tactic. “Influencer marketing is like word of mouth but times 1000,” says Amsterdam based marketing specialist. By leveraging existing credibility and equity that someone else has brands are better able to convince consumers to try or buy their product. Another marketing expert compared influencer marketing as “the equivalent of getting a five-star review of a product from your best friend.” Consumers are tired of being told by brands that they are amazing, they no longer trust that kind of advertisement.  The director of eBay and P&G, Scott Cook, is quoted saying, “a brand is no longer what we tell consumers it is, it is what consumers tell each other it is.”

<p>
  <h3> <b> Expanded Audience</b> </h3>
  When asking what some of the biggest benefits of using influencer marketing was, time and time again marketing experts said leveraging an influencer’s follower base. Having the opportunity to get in front of someone else’s audience who you would otherwise not be seen by considerably increases your brand reach. Many times consumers don’t directly follow brands, so collaborating with influencers can help to bring either brand awareness or strengthen brand loyalty with those followers.

      <h1 style="text-align: center; color:black;">  WHEN DO YOU WANT TO USE INFLUENCER MARKETING </h1>
      <p>
        When thinking about whether or not influencer marketing would be right for you, a key aspect to think about is what you are trying to achieve. While influencer marketing can be a very effective marketing strategy, it isn’t always the answer for what you may be looking to achieve. When speaking with influencer specialist the most common reasons to use influencer marketing were as follows:
  </p>

  <p>
    <h3> <b> Brand Awareness & Reach </b> </h3>
  Start small and choose 2-3 influencers you want to work with and then narrow it down from there. You don’t have to launch a giant campaign with a mega-influencer to move the needle. When using influencer marketing choosing a couple of micro-influencers as opposed to one mega-influencer can often times be much more successful in creating more engagement and reach, as well as more cost effective.  </p>

    <h3> <b> Engagement</b> </h3>
    One of the most common reasons marketers choose to use influencer marketing is to create higher engagement rates with consumers. In a study done by Medium, they found that micro-influencer campaigns had a 60% higher engagement rate than traditional advertising.
    An example of this is a campaign called #willfindsaway that was recently launched this year. The campaign was focused on promoting a new collection of Under Armour clothing in the UK, Germany and France. However, instead of just running a normal social media strategy pushing the products, the brand chose to use influencers marketing to dig much deeper than that. For this campaign, Under Armour partnered with both a macro-influencer and multiple micro-influencers to post on Instagram featuring the branded hashtag, #willfindaway, the new Under Armour products, as well as included a personal struggle or battle they’ve had and how sports helped them overcome it. Not only did the results from the campaign created massive engagement, it also got other Instagram users to use this hashtag.

</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>
      <h3> <b> Sales/Conversions</b> </h3>
      In a study conducted by Nielsen, it was found that influencer marketing content delivered 11 times higher return on investment than traditional forms of digital marketing (Ahmad, 2018).
  One of the best examples of influencer marketing being used as a mechanism to drive sales and conversion is the marketing strategy used by makeup company, Glossier. Since the brand launch, Glossier has marketed their product almost entirely using influencer marketing on Instagram and YouTube.

  According to Weiss, revenues are up 600% year over year and the brand has been able to tripe their active customer count in the past year (Liu, 2017).
  One of their most successful launches has actually been gifting 500 super fans who had previously bought the most products or were the most engaged with the new product, thereby turning the super fans into their very own “free” influencers.

      <h1 style="text-align: center; color:black;">  WHAT MAKES A SUCCESSFUL INFLUENCER MARKETING CAMPAIGN </h1>
      <p>
        Since marketers have started using influencer marketing more and more, the development of industry best practices have emerged when implementing an influencer strategies. Below is a list of some of the most common practices brought up when speaking with marketing experts, specifically for Instagram. </p>
<p>
  <h3> <b> Cultivate Meaningful Relationships </b> </h3>
    Unlike billboards, influencers are living breathing human beings who deserve to be treated as more than an ad unit. By creating a relationship with influencers you can create mutual benefits such as established trust, knowledge of each other, a ready customer base, and the opportunity of switching the brand influencer to a brand advocate (Biaudet, 2017). When discussing the most important parts of influencer marketing, almost all experts expressed that long-term relationships between brands and influencers are essential for successful collaboration. It was also suggested that once the campaign is finished, thanking the influencer for their participation and letting them know you’d be interested in working with them again helped when collaborating on future projects.

  </p>
</blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3> <b> Measure Results </b> </h3>
      What’s the point of marketing without results? Like any other marketing tactic, influencer marketing needs to be managed from before the campaign even starts to after the campaign ends to truly get of sense of how successful the campaign was. In order to track these results one may have to get creative to measure the results, but consider using some of the following:
<ul>
  <li> Coupon Codes </li>
  <li> Affiliate Landing Pages </li>
  <li> Swipe-Up Links </li>
  <li> <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://nicoleavalos.github.io/alissasound.mp3" data-start="810000" data-end="835000" data-plays="1"></span>Google UTMs</li>
  <li> Branded Hashtags </li>
</ul>
With the help of search analytics, listening tools, dedicated messaging, landing pages, and more, marketers can begin to understand who and what is offering the greatest ROI, where they need to adapt brand messages, and which influencer content they should optimize and amplify (Biaudet, 2017). How influencer marketing ROI is measured depends on the objective decided upon prior to campaign launch. If the campaign is focused on brand awareness, marketers would be more concerned about reach. Whereas if the focus of the campaign was engagement, the amount of likes, views, shares or clicks would be a better statistic to look at. </br>

If they are looking for engagement, you can look at hashtags and see how much conversation was generated around it.
</p>
</blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3> <b> Set Expectations From the Start </b> </h3>
      Accurately expressing what you want from an influencer is critical in receiving your anticipated goals for a specific campaign. Once you have chosen the influencer or influencers you want to work with it is crucial to provide them with a brief of information such as project timeline, expected content of post, and compensation details.
    This can sometimes be a hard thing to do when the influencer is not technically being compensated other than given a free product, which is why choosing the right influencer is very important.
    <blockquote>

  </p>
    </blockquote>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h3> <b> Transparency </b> </h3>
      Consumers are constantly being bombarded with misleading advertisements, so it is important to remain transparent when working with influencers. When speaking with a relatively known influencer about how to balance working with brands and staying transparent with their audience she said, “The number one thing is staying true to your brand. It can be very enticing to take on any campaign that come your way because that is direct income, but when you do that, it becomes very obvious to your audience, and therefore, they will slowly lose trust in what you’re putting out there.” She continued by saying, “the best way to stay transparent is really building that connection with your audience by engaging with them often, like answering messages and comments as much as you can. That, in addition to working with brands that you truly believe in and use, is what separates you from the rest.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3> <b> Storytelling & Innovative Marketing Strategies</b> </h3>
      On top of implementing an influencer strategy, developing a storytelling content-driven campaign for influencers can help to make the campaign more relevant and resonate more with followers, as well as increase engagement. When speaking to a marketing expert she says, “the story is more important than the product when it comes to influencer marketing, people connect with the influencer on a personal level, therefore are more inclined to buy the product when attached to a story.” For the content to really resonate with the target audience, the influencer needs to tell a story around the brand or product. It has become common to see influencers promoting products, so you have to be careful to not become part of the noise and create a campaign that will stand out and highlight the importance of your brand or product. A brand, service or product is trusted more when an influencer includes a personal story about it as opposed to just offering a product review (Biaudet, 2017).
</p>
<p>
  <h3> <b> Creative Control</b> </h3>
    As already stated throughout the paper, conveying authenticity is extremely important when working with influencers. One of the ways marketers can ensure a more authentic feel is letting the influencer have some creative control on what content is created for the campaign. Influencers should always be given a creative brief which specifies how the brand should be presented but overall influencers should have complete freedom over the content they create. However, from time to time, certain brands may have specifications in terms of exclusivity. For example, a clothing brand may wish to be the only brand featured in a post and thus must specify that the influencer does not show other pieces of clothing in the post. Aside from specifications such as that, all marketing experts agreed that creative freedom results in some of the best campaign outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3> <b> Run An Ongoing Campaign </b> </h3>
    While running a one-off campaign can help bring awareness to an upcoming product launch, if you are wanting to create a more comprehensive campaign to promote your brand then running a more long-term campaign will be most effective. Ongoing campaigns will create more opportunities for your target market to consume as much content about your brand as possible, as well become more familiar with your brand position.   </p>
    <p>
      <h3> <b> Quality over Quantity</b> </h3>
  Start small and choose 2-3 influencers you want to work with and then narrow it down from there. You don’t have to launch a giant campaign with a mega-influencer to move the needle. When using influencer marketing choosing a couple of micro-influencers as opposed to one mega-influencer can often times be much more successful in creating more engagement and reach, as well as more cost effective.  </p>
      <p>
        <h3> <b> It’s All About the Gram </b> </h3>
          Instagram is a platform that allows for creative and visually pleasing content, making it an ideal platform for brand storytelling. On top of this, millions of people use Instagram daily. This means that the potential reach on this platform is likely to reach millions. Also, features such as “stories” with swipe up links and featured stories have made an opportunity for brands to drive audiences directly to their websites.

      <h1 style="text-align: center; color:black;">  WHO DO YOU CHOOSE WHEN BUILDING AN INFLUENER MARKETING CAMPAIGN </h1>
      <p>
        To start an influencer marketing campaign, you have to first find an influencer. So how do you go about choosing which influencer would be the best fit for your brand and brand image? There are many things to take into consideration when creating an influencer marketing campaign, however when speaking with influencer marketing experts the ways in which they identify and choose influencers were relatively the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Businesses have long partnered with celebrities and other high-profile stars as a way to promote products and add credibility to their brand, however social media has given rise to non-celebrity online influencers particularly on Instagram. Most marketers’ separate these influencers into three different tiers: micro-influencers, macro-influencers and mega-influencers. However, the majority of marketing professionals I spoke with expressed a preferred use of micro or a combination of micro and macro influencers when conducting a campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      While both macro and mega influencers have significant follower counts, that doesn’t necessarily mean they have a high engagement (Hart, 2017). Marketers have found that with more social savvy consumers the power in influencer marketing isn’t necessary about follower count anymore as it is about getting higher engagement (Hart, 2017).
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the last few years, the trend in influencer marketing has been the use of more micro-influencers as opposed to their higher followed peers. By definition micro-influencers are typically individuals with a smaller following who have a more expert knowledge on certain niche subjects. Their knowledge in those particular subjects is what attracts a more targeted audience. These smaller influencers can be more effective because of their close relationship to their close, loyal and hyper-targeted communities (Hart, 2017). Since they have a smaller more intimate following, they are also able to manage a stronger two-way dialogue with their followers than an influencer with a higher follower count.

      For brands looking to boost online visibility and customer engagement, investing in micro-influencer marketing can be a game-changer.

      However, finding the right micro-influencer can be time-consuming and like trying to find a needle in a haystack. No brand wants to work with influencers who are only concerned about the money, as opposed to really caring about the product they are endorsing. Choosing a serial-influencer, or influencer who works with many different brands, is also not a favorable route for the risk of looking un-authentic. Here are several ways to help find your perfect influencer:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b> Already Existing Brand Promoters </b></br> Choosing micro-influencers who are already familiar with your brand have previously used your products can sometimes be the best brand ambassadors. Since they are already familiar with your product or brand, it can be a lot easier to build a more authentic campaign. Influencers are also typically more inclined to partner with products and brands they already believe in, as opposed to new products.
  </li>
  <li><b> Keywords and Hashtags </b></br> This is especially helpful when looking for a more niche influencers. By searching popular industry hashtags on Instagram you'll find out which power players are curating the most engaging content relevant to you and your particular brand.
  “When you have very niche brands, you have to manually go through and search keywords,” says influencer expert.
  </li>
  <li><b> Influencer Databases </b></br> While the above ways can be time consuming, there is a faster way to come up with a list of possible influencers. Influencer databases such as BuzzSumo, Klear and Ninja Outreach help to curate a ready-made list of possible fits for your marketing campaign. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  After deciding upon a handful of influencer to possibly work with, it is then important to critically look at the influencer and if they are right for your brand. There are four important factors to look at when examining an influencer: relevance, reach, engagement rate and authenticity (Biaudet, 2017). You want to ensure that you brand image and messaging aligns with the influencers’ content, as well as if your brand or product is relevant to their audience. Taking a look at past post to get a sense of their feed is a helpful way to gauge if the partnership would be beneficial.
  Examining the engagement ratio of the influencer is crucial to determining how meaningful the relationship between the influencer and their audience is. You can determine this by looking at the comments, likes and shares of the influencers’ posts. The third criteria to look for is audience reach. Making sure that the influencers’ audience is the audience you want to reach. Lastly, ensuring the influencer is authentic. Influencers who have less sponsored content on their platform, tend to be seen as more trustworthy and authentic (Biaudet, 2017).

        <h1 style="text-align: center; color:black;">  CONCLUSION
      </h1>
<p>
  In a time when most consumers are using ad blockers to avoid brand advertisements, influencer marketing allows brands to break into consumers’ social community in a way that feels much more organic and welcomed because it is relevant, reliable and more relatable to them. With social media growing in inﬂuence and advertising agencies allocating more of their media budgets to social, the advertising industry is in search of effective strategies to get the most return on investment when it comes to social (Wood, 2016). Unfortunately, it is no longer enough to just be present on social media, brands must now be actively trying to engage and relate to their target market. The main objective of this white paper was to provide better understanding of influencer marketing and how it can be used to leverage existing niche communities. Influencer marketing is built upon century old traditions of word of mouth, however with the emergence of social media the number of consumers a person can reach has amplified. As consumers have become more tech savvy, marketers have turned to more digital-based strategies to connect with their customers.
</p>
<p>
    Inﬂuencer marketing is proving to be successful and will continue to grow in popularity as more advertising dollars are allocated towards it. While working with inﬂuencers can be a tricky process, the returns on investment are unparalleled if well executed (Wood, 2016). As more and more marketers adopt influencer marketing as a new strategy, it is important to establish some of the current best practices and industry norms being implemented. However, since social media is constantly changing and evolving it is imperative for marketers to keep up with industry trends and regulations. Inﬂuencer Marketing is relatively new research area that has the potential to be explored. Future research on the difference between micro and macro influencer in relation to reach, engagement and authenticity would be beneficial to this area of study.
